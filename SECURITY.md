Here’s a **strong, clear, and actionable** security policy template for your repository, tailored to open-source projects and best practices:

---

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We actively provide security updates for the following versions of this project:



| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

**Note:** Only the latest major version and the previous major version receive security updates. Older versions are unsupported and may contain unpatched vulnerabilities.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

### **1. How to Report**
- **GitHub Security Advisory:** If you have a GitHub account, you can [submit a vulnerability via GitHub’s Security Advisory feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

### **2. What to Include**
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, remote code execution).
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

### **3. What to Expect**
- **Acknowledgment:** You’ll receive a response within **48 hours** confirming receipt of your report.
- **Triage:** We’ll assess the vulnerability and determine its severity.
- **Updates:** You’ll receive regular updates on the progress of the fix.
- **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is accepted, we’ll work on a patch and release it as soon as possible.
- **Disclosure:** We’ll publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired) after a fix is released.

### **4. Out of Scope**
- Issues related to unsupported versions.
- Reports of non-exploitable weaknesses or theoretical risks without proof of concept.

---

### **Additional Best Practices**
- **Responsible Disclosure:** We ask that you keep the vulnerability confidential until we release a fix.
- **Bug Bounty:** If applicable, mention whether you offer rewards for valid reports.

Would you like me to adapt this further for your specific project (e.g., adding a bug bounty program, customizing the contact method, or including a PGP key for encrypted reports)?
